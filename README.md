<h2>What is Chat Engine?</h2>
<p>Chat Engine simplifies the process of developing chat services by providing an API that streamlines the creation of chats, which would otherwise be complex and time-consuming to build from scratch. Additionally, it offers a Rest API for hosting chats and npm components to assist in designing the chat user interface. The comprehensive documentation guides users on customizing components and integrating them to meet their specific requirements. <a href="https://chatengine.io/">Click here to visit chat engine</a></p>

<h2>What is OpenAi?</h2>
<p>OpenAI functions as an artificial intelligence research organization, offering developers access to potent AI models through their API key. These models play a crucial role in the development of chat applications, enabling functionalities such as code generation, text creation, and predictive text completion with insightful suggestions as we type. <a href="https://openai.com/">Click here to visit openai</a> </p>
